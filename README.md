# Sorting-Visualization
This is sorting algorithms visualizer with 5 different popular sorting algoriths.\
# Algorithims Included:
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Selection Sort

I built this application because I was interested in sorting algorithms and wanted to see the differences between each algorithm visually.
